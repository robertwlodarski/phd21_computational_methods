# PhD21 Computational methods: Assignments

# Content

The repository contains a few folders. 
- `assignment_n`: In each of such folders, I store the code solving each of the assignments.
- `booklet`: This folder contains the written responses to each assignment.


# Requirements
- `Matlab`: Apart from the standard tools, you need to download the *Global Optimisation Toolbox* for some of my calibration experiments.
- `LaTeX`: I use standard VSCode for that. You may need to follow their instructions.
