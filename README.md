# PhD21 Computational methods: Assignments

# Content

The repository contains a few folders. 
- `assignment_n`: In each of such folders, I store the code solving each of the assignments.
- `booklet`: This folder contains the written responses to each assignment.


# Requirements
Don't expect rocket science here. 
- `Matlab`: Apart from the standard tools, you need to download the *Global Optimisation Toolbox* for some of my calibration experiments.
- `LaTeX`: I use the standard VSCode for that. You may need to follow their instructions. 
- `Julia`: I try to translate the assignments to Julia, as well. I recommend using it with VSCode.

# Problem sets

**Note**: I've found a few errors in assignment 2, and I am updating it slowly. 

1. RBC GE with labour participation.
2. A simple life-cycle PE model.
3. Aiyagari (QJE, 1994)
3. Aiyagari (QJE, 1994): Transitional dynamics
